Description: General-purpose MCMC and SMC samplers, as well as plots and
    diagnostic functions for Bayesian statistics, with a particular focus on
    calibrating complex system models. Implemented samplers include various
    Metropolis MCMC variants (including adaptive and/or delayed rejection MH), the
    T-walk, two differential evolution MCMCs, two DREAM MCMCs, and a sequential
    Monte Carlo (SMC) particle filter.
