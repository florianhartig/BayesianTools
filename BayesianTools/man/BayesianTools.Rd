\description{
This package contains general-purpose Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) and Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers, along with diagnostic
functions and plots used for Bayesian statistics.
}
\details{
This package works particularly for process-based models.

The package includes two primary functions, \code{\link{createBayesianSetup}},
which creates a standardized Bayesian setup with likelihood and priors, and
\code{\link{runMCMC}}, which allows various MCMC and SMC samplers to be run.

Additionally, the package can be used for general (non-Bayesian) target
functions.

To use this package, start by creating a BayesianSetup using
\code{\link{createBayesianSetup}}. Generally, a BayesianSetup contains priors
and likelihood densities, or in general, a target function.

You can sample with \code{\link{runMCMC}} function. This function can call
several general
purpose Metropolis samplers including the \code{\link{Metropolis}}. This
function allows you to specify various popular Metropolis variants such as
adaptive and/or delayed rejection Metropolis; two variants of differential
evolution MCMC - \code{\link{DE}} and \code{\link{DEzs}}, two variants of DREAM -
\code{\link{DREAM}} and \code{\link{DREAMzs}}, the \code{\link{Twalk}} MCMC,
and a Sequential Monte Carlo sampler \code{\link{smcSampler}}.

If a single run is performed, the output of runMCMC is of class mcmcSampler /
smcSampler, otherwise, it would be of class mcmcSamplerList / smcSamplerList.
To plot, compare models (DIC, marginal likelihood) or use the output as a
new prior, several functions are available.
